My name is Taylor Stevens and I am a computer science graduate from Northeastern University's Khoury College. With a diverse background in full-stack software engineering, software development, and data analysis, I have worked on a range of projects that have given me a wealth of experience in problem-solving and collaboration.

One project that I am particularly proud of is the Fostered Food project, a mutual aid initiative that focuses on reducing food waste and increasing food access for low-income and food-insecure individuals. As the project lead, I have been able to expand my understanding of food insecurity in the Greater Boston area and develop my skills in project management and community outreach.

In addition to my professional experiences, I have a passion for public service and mutual aid, and I am driven by a desire to make the world a better place. My personal interests include playing rugby as a wing, going bouldering indoors and outdoors, and hiking and camping in the White Mountains in New Hampshire.

Looking ahead, I am excited to pursue my goals and aspirations in the Agricultural Technology sector, where I hope to help improve modern farming and reduce the effects of global warming. With a resolution-oriented approach to problem-solving and a strong ability to work both independently and collaboratively, I am confident that I will be able to make a positive impact in this field.
