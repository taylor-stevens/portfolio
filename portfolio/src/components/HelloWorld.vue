          About
          <br><br>
          My name is Taylor Stevens and I am a Software Engineer with a degree in Computer Science from Northeastern University 
          where I concentrated in Artificial Intelligence. I have a diverse background with full-stack development where I have worked
          with tools from React and Linux to Nginx and Pyspark. Driven from a passion for public service and mutual aid, I have worked 
          on a range of projects that given me experience in complex problem-solving, leadership, and collaboration.
          <br><br>
          One project that I am particularly proud of is the FosteredFood project, a mutual aid initiative that focuses on reducing food 
          waste and increasing food access for low-income and food-insecure individuals. As the project lead, I have been able to expand 
          and develop my skills in project management and community outreach as well as my technical skills with Typescript, React, Google 
          API's, and more. 
          <br><br>
          My personal interests include playing rugby as a wing, going bouldering indoors and outdoors, and hiking and camping in the White 
          Mountains in New Hampshire.
